### My preferred name is Irael. I'm from Texas and have recently discovered that I have a passion for software development! I have a bachelor's in Mathematics and a background in Business Management. I recently graduated from Flatiron School, which was one of the best decisions I've made in my life. I love solving puzzles and strategically thinking to create solutions. I am a science enthusiast, escpecially in the fields of physics and psychology.
